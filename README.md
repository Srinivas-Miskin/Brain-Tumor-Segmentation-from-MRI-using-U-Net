# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-from-MRI-using-U-Net
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for automatic brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans using a U-Net-based Convolutional Neural Network. The model learns pixel-level tumor regions to support clinical decision-making and medical image analysis.
